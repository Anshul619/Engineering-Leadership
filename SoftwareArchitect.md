# What Software Architects Do That Programmers DON'T?
- Hereâ€™s a clear table summarizing the video content and the 10 aspects of being a software architect compared to a typical programmer.


| #  | Aspect                      | Meaning / Focus                                                                                 | Difference from Typical Programmer                                                                                       |
| -- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | **Zoom In / Zoom Out**      | Ability to switch between high-level system vision and detailed technical work.                 | Programmers often focus on solving detailed coding tasks, while architects must balance big-picture vision with details. |
| 2  | **Domain Sensitive**        | Deeply understand the business domain and how software fits into it.                            | Programmers may only need to understand requirements, but architects must align software with business goals.            |
| 3  | **Understand Tradeoffs**    | Evaluate pros/cons of design decisions (performance vs. flexibility, etc.).                     | Programmers might optimize locally, architects must weigh long-term tradeoffs.                                           |
| 4  | **Selfless Decision Maker** | Make choices for the benefit of the team/product, not personal preference.                      | Programmers can lean on personal coding style, architects must prioritize the collective good.                           |
| 5  | **Embrace Change**          | Adapt architecture to evolving requirements and technologies.                                   | Programmers often react to changes in tasks; architects must design with change in mind.                                 |
| 6  | **Communicative Mastery**   | Clearly communicate designs, decisions, and tradeoffs to technical and non-technical audiences. | Programmers mostly communicate with peers, architects bridge multiple stakeholders.                                      |
| 7  | **Infrastructure Aware**    | Understand infrastructure, deployment, security, and system operations.                         | Programmers may not need deep infrastructure knowledge, architects must consider it in designs.                          |
| 8  | **Strategic Coder**         | Write code that sets direction, prototypes, and standards - not all production code.              | Programmers focus on building features; architects code more strategically.                                              |
| 9  | **Consider Scale**          | Design systems that handle growth (users, data, traffic).                                       | Programmers optimize current features; architects ensure scalability.                                                    |
| 10 | **Cost Sensitive**          | Keep in mind financial cost of infrastructure, tools, and solutions.                            | Programmers rarely handle cost considerations; architects must balance tech vs. budget.                                  |
